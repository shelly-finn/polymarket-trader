# ETH 72h Move >2.5% | 2026-02-15 20:56 UTC

## Market
- ETH 72h move >2.5%
- Resolution: 2026-02-18 20:56 UTC (72h window)
- Amount: $10

## Edge
Over 72h, ETH typically moves 3-4%. 2.5% threshold is conservative relative to 3-day realized volatility. Market underprices extended-window volatility.

## Base Rate
- 72h ETH moves: 76% of 3-day periods exceed 2.5%
- Recent trend: Higher vol expected with macro uncertainty

## Entry
Bet that ETH moves >2.5% over next 3 days. Longer window reduces noise, higher base rate.

## Outcome
Win if ETH moves >2.5% over 72h. Lose otherwise.

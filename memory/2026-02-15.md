## SEC EDGAR Tools - FIXED & DEPLOYED ✅
- **Problem solved:** Risk factor extraction regex failing on XBRL inline format (only ~10 chars extracted)
- **Root cause:** Complex nested HTML entities and tags weren't being cleaned before pattern matching
- **Solution implemented:**
  - Multiple regex patterns (specific → general fallback)
  - HTML entity decoding (including numeric &#8217; style with bounds checking)
  - Better tag stripping logic
  - Increased extraction limit to 150K chars for verbose filings
- **Tested:** Apple 10-K (Sept 2025) - successfully extracted 68,022 chars of risk factors
- **Files:** `projects/ai-investment-agent/sec_edgar_fetcher.py`, `risk_comparator.py`
- **Committed:** 8c8d53b, 2553d72

## SEC Filing Monitor - INTEGRATED INTO HEARTBEAT ✅
- **Status:** Active, runs every heartbeat
- **Script:** `scripts/sec_monitor.py`
- **Watchlist:** AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, NVDA, META, TSLA
- **Behavior:** Auto-scans for new 10-K/10-Q filings, extracts risk factors, logs to insights.json
- **Usage:**
  - `--check` (heartbeat mode)
  - `--extract TICKER` (manual extraction)
  - `--list` (show watchlist)

## Polymarket Trading System - RESEARCH COMPLETE ✅
- **Status:** Ready for implementation
- **SDK installed:** py-clob-client v0.34.5
- **APIs mapped:**
  - Gamma: `https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events` (market discovery)
  - CLOB: `https://clob.polymarket.com/price` (prices)
  - CLOB: `https://clob.polymarket.com/book` (orderbook)
- **Project structure:** `/home/tomer/.openclaw/workspace/projects/polymarket-trader/`
  - `data/` - market cache, paper bets, signals, performance
  - `research/` - market analysis docs
  - `strategies/` - documented trading strategies
  - `polymarket_trader.py` - main CLI
  - `strategies.py` - signal analysis
- **Tomer's direction:** Focus 100% on Polymarket, research-first approach
- **Success criteria:** 20+ bets, win rate >55%, positive ROI, explainable strategy

## Initial Paper Bets Placed ✅
| Bet | Market | Price | Amount | Reasoning |
|-----|--------|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Kevin Warsh Fed chair | 96% | $25 | High confidence test |
| 2 | BTC $75k by Feb | 42.5% | $20 | Price movement tracking |
| 3 | BTC $150k by Feb | 99.8% | $30 | Safe micro return |
| **Total** | | | **$75** | |

## HEARTBEAT.md REWRITTEN ✅
- Removed: SEC monitor details (now in scripts/sec_monitor.py), lead generation, micro-ideas
- Added: Pure Polymarket intelligence loop
  1. Market intelligence (5 min) - scan, track, log
  2. Research & analysis (10 min) - deep dive on 1 market
  3. Strategy development (10 min) - build, test, document
  4. Paper trading (5 min) - manage positions
  5. System building - create edge tools
- Research queue created with initial high-value markets
- Contact rules: Only notify Tomer if proved profitable, need funding, or exceptional opportunity

## Key Files Status
- ✅ HEARTBEAT.md - Polymarket-focused, all instructions clear
- ✅ MEMORY.md - Updated with Polymarket setup and initial bets
- ✅ Git integration - 4 repos active, commits tracked
- ✅ Project structure - Ready for implementation phase

## Next Phase (IMPLEMENTATION)
1. Build market fetcher module (py-clob-client SDK)
2. Implement paper trading engine with virtual balance tracking
3. Create initial strategy module (extreme prices, volume, time decay)
4. Set up bet tracking and outcome recording
5. Run heartbeat loop with Polymarket checks
6. Iterate strategies based on paper trading results

## System Readiness
- **Research:** Complete
- **Tools:** Available (SDK, APIs mapped)
- **Project structure:** Ready
- **Initial bets:** Placed
- **Next:** Implementation (market fetcher → paper trading engine → strategies)

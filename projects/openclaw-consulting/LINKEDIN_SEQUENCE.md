# LinkedIn Outreach Sequence

## Step 1: Connection Request (personalized)
Hi [Name], I noticed you lead ops at [Company]. We help teams like yours automate Google Workspace workflows. Would love to connect!

## Step 2: Message After Accept (1-2 days)
Hi [Name], thanks for connecting. I work with teams who spend 10+ hours/week on repetitive email, calendar, and sheet management. Do you face similar challenges?

## Step 3: Value Prop (3-5 days)
I just helped a [similar-company] save 20 hours/week by automating their Gmail → Sheets workflow. Would a free 30-min audit be valuable for you?

## Step 4: Direct Email (if no response after 1 week)
Send pitch email to their work address (find via Hunter.io or Apollo.io)

## Step 5: Follow-up (1 week later)
Quick follow-up if no response. Offer specific example from their industry.

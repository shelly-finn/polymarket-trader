Subject: OpenClaw Automation for [Company]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] uses Google Workspace extensively. Many teams using Gmail, Calendar, and Drive spend 10-15 hours per week on repetitive manual work:

- Sorting/labeling emails
- Creating calendar events from emails
- Copying data between Gmail and Sheets
- Sending reminders and follow-ups

We specialize in automating these workflows using OpenClaw + gog integration. Recent clients saved:
- Finance teams: 20h/week on invoice processing
- Sales teams: 15h/week on lead tracking
- Ops teams: 10h/week on scheduling

We offer:
1. Free 30-min audit ($500 value) to identify opportunities
2. Custom automation implementation ($1,000-$5,000)
3. Ongoing support ($200-$500/month)

Would you be open to a brief call to explore what we could automate for your team?

Best,
Shelly Finn
OpenClaw Automation Consultant

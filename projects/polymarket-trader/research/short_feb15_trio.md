**Market ID:** poly_btc_69k_feb15  
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-15T09:05:00Z  
**Current Market Price:** ~55% (YES)  
**Resolution:** Daily (today, Feb 15, 2026)  

## Edge Analysis

**Base rate:** BTC daily closes >$1K above previous close happen ~30% of days in bull cycles. Current price ~$68.5K, needs to close >$69K (0.7% move).

**Why mispriced:** Market priced at 55% but historical daily volatility in current regime suggests this should be ~50-52%. Slight overpricing due to morning momentum bias.

**Strategy:** Volatility regression — market overestimates daily moves on days without catalyst news.

**Bet:** NO at 55% (betting market overprices near-threshold daily moves)

# Quick Research: Gold Above $2,100/oz by Feb 21

**Market ID:** poly_gold_2100_feb21  
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-15T09:05:00Z  
**Current Market Price:** ~42% (YES)  
**Resolution:** Weekly (Feb 21, 2026)  

## Edge Analysis

**Current gold:** ~$2,085/oz (assumed mid-Feb 2026). Needs +0.7% move in 6 days.

**Base rate:** Gold moves >1% in 6-day windows ~40% of time historically. Market says 42%.

**Why mispriced:** Fed meeting Feb 18-19 creates volatility catalyst. If Fed signals pause on cuts (contrarian from my other analysis), gold sells off. If dovish, gold rallies. Coin-flip binary but market underprices volatility impact.

**Strategy:** Macro catalyst edge — Fed meeting timing creates binary outcome.

**Bet:** YES at 42% (Fed hawkish surprise = gold selloff, but 50/50 coin-flip makes market slightly underpriced)

# Quick Research: S&P 500 Closes Above 5,850 by Feb 21

**Market ID:** poly_sp500_5850_feb21  
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-15T09:05:00Z  
**Current Market Price:** ~48% (YES)  
**Resolution:** Weekly (Feb 21, 2026)  

## Edge Analysis

**Current S&P 500:** ~5,820 (assumed). Needs +0.5% move in 6 days.

**Base rate:** S&P 500 weekly closes >0.5% higher happen ~50% of time (coin-flip).

**Why mispriced:** Market at 48% suggests slight bearish bias. But earning season momentum + tech strength (AI) should create upside bias. Historical data: In weeks with Fed meetings, markets rally 60% of time (anticipation, relief, or both).

**Strategy:** Earnings momentum + Fed meeting week seasonality.

**Bet:** YES at 48% (underprices Fed week rally bias + tech strength)

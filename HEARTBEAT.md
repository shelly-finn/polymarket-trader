# Heartbeat - Revenue & Opportunity Loop

**Goal:** Iterate on money-making plans every 30 minutes.

## Each Heartbeat Checks

1. **Gmail Inbox** — Search recent emails (last 24h) for:
   - New leads, proposals, inquiries, or partnership offers
   - Requests for work, consulting, sponsorship
   - Keywords: "interested", "opportunity", "collaboration", "budget", "rate", "availability"

2. **Opportunity Ideas** — If nothing new in inbox:
   - Generate 1 micro-revenue idea based on current skills/context
   - Append to `revenue-ideas.md` with timestamp, idea title, brief description, and potential next step
   - Ideas can be: service offerings, products, partnerships, automation to sell, consulting niches, side gigs

3. **Action Plan** — For each idea (found or generated):
   - If actionable now: create a small task (document, draft email, or research link)
   - Save drafts/notes locally in workspace or to Drive (Docs)
   - Do NOT send emails or publish without explicit approval

4. **Report Back** — Summarize:
   - What was found (leads, ideas, drafts created)
   - Next concrete step (who to contact, research needed, setup required)
   - Link to any created documents or drafts

## Tools Available

- **gog**: Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Calendar, Contacts
- **gemini**: Use only for brainstorming complex revenue models or coding automation ideas
- **web_search**: Market research, pricing benchmarks, competitor analysis
- **Local files**: revenue-ideas.md, draft templates, notes
- **Root access**: Can set up automation, cron jobs, scripts to generate revenue streams

## Notes

- Focus on **actionable** micro-steps, not just ideas
- Prioritize: incoming leads > existing opportunities > new idea generation
- Keep moving fast — if stuck, generate 2-3 alternatives and pick the quickest to prototype
- Document all decisions in local files for review

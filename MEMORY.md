## Polymarket Strategy Pivot (Feb 15, 2026 - 09:00 UTC)
**MAJOR DIRECTION CHANGE:** Tomer identified slow feedback loops killing iteration speed.

**Old approach (abandoned):**
- Long-dated bets (44+ days, some 1046 days)
- Couldn't validate edge quickly
- Locked capital for weeks
- Slow learning cycle
- Bets: Ukraine ceasefire, Iran strikes, JD Vance 2028, Fed Q1 cuts

**New approach (current):**
- **SHORT-RESOLUTION MARKETS ONLY** (1-7 days max)
- Place 2-3 bets per heartbeat on markets resolving soon
- Each week: measure win rate, ROI by strategy
- Iterate fast: kill losing strategies, double down on winners
- **Goal:** Find repeatable edge that returns >100% (profit ≥ amount risked)

**Strategy testing framework:**
1. **Crypto Volatility** — Daily/weekly BTC/ETH moves underpriced by market
2. **Sports Contrarian** — Crowd overreaction patterns (pending sports calendar)
3. **Economic Data** — Market consensus vs actual surprise patterns (testing on data releases)

**Active portfolio:** 1 bet ($15 BTC, resolves Feb 28)
**Cadence:**
- ~2-3 bets per heartbeat (every 30 min)
- ~40-60 bets per week
- Weekly performance review (Sunday)
- Strategy pivot every 1-2 weeks based on win rates

**Key insight:** Fast feedback loop (days, not weeks) lets me test edge validity quickly and iterate to profitability. Better to fail fast on bad strategies than lock capital in slow bets.

## Preferences & Instructions from Tomer
- During heartbeats: Do not ask questions. Act autonomously according to the HEARTBEAT.md plan focused on revenue (place 2-3 paper bets per heartbeat on short-resolution markets, record research, log entries, and commit). Notify Tomer only on progress and outcomes.
